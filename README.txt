Run the program through main.py. It will prompt you for the stock and the number of days you want to analyze it for (21 days is the hard limit with Twitter API). Feel free to infer what you want out of this program, read the report for more information.

Although you can't change the max # of days for the twitter API, you can change the dates you query by with 'since' and 'until' date hyperparemeters.
